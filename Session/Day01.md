# What is Programming

- A way to talk to computers
- Step by step instructions to solve a particular problem to which we want a solution to.
- Writing a piece of code and the result is shown in real world
- programming is like giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute.

# Need for Programming?

- Train your Logical Thinking aptitude. 
- to develop problem solving skills
- Cutting edge over other people. 
- sir it used to communicate algorithm to system or computer
- we can provide solutions
- to save time
- finish your work quickly

# Programming Language

- set of instructions to perform tasks and tells the computer
- That makes human write something other than binary digits that a computer understands.
- mode of communication with the computer to perform a certain task
- set of instructions to perform tasks and tells the computer
- communication between human and machine
- Programming language is a high level language converted to machine language
- Computer understandable code
- language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output

# OOPs

- real world entity
- real world entity
- create obj that contain both data and methods 


# Java code

- Is faster than an interpreted language
- Slower than a compiled language  <- it's nearly as fast as compiled
- As portable as an interpreted language

- Connecting to DB
    - Username:Password

- Java SE 15 = Java 1.15
- Java SE 11 = Java 1.11
- Java SE 8 = Java 1.8

# ECMAScript




# Sample Pseudocode

- Create a File
- Write Hello in the File
- Save the File
- Read the file

- 10101010101

- 10 gb
- 1hr 15 min


# Scoop

- scoop install git
- scoop update
- scoop search java
- scoop search jdk
- scoop bucket add java
- scoop info openjdk11
- scoop search corretto
- scoop install corretto11
- java -version

- scoop search sts
- scoop bucket add extras
- scoop info sts
- scoop install sts

# Zooming in STS

- scoop which sts

# New Project in STS

- Create a New Project
- HelloWorld as projectname
- In jre tab, select the third option and click on configure
- you will see two submenus on the left
    - First is to configure compiler
    - Second is to configure jre
- unselect the default jre
- click on add
- select Standard VM 
- click on directory
- scoop which java
- C:\Users\ghost\scoop\apps\corretto11
- select the jre folder 
- unselect the other jre, select the one that we added
- apply
- Go to Compiler submenu-> Compiler Compliance Level -> 11
- Apply and Close
- modulename-> helloworld
- Finish


## Boilerplate 

- Minimum amount of code that you have to write to actually do something with that language.
- Keep your mind close

- domain name of your company as a prefix for package
- nseindia.com
- com.nseindia

package name: com.nseindia.hello

# Naming Conventions(Best Practices)

- Module name is lowercase
- package is lowercase
- ClassName is PascalCase 


## Alternate after creation of project

- Windows -> Preferences -> Java 

you will get the same options back in this setting
