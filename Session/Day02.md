# Variables

## Raw

- Storing Value
- Memory Location is allocated when a variable is created
- Every Variable must be given a value before using it.
- Memory Allocation is done when an object is created
- value vs reference

# Definition of a Variable

- A named storage location
- It's value can be changed/varied
- We can use the variable name to assign, read, and modify values

# Variable Definition

```
dataType variableName = value;
```

- Variables and Literals
    - Literal :"Hello World", 3,2.3,-11
    - Variable: newVariableName

## Statically Typed Language

- Statically Typed Language vs Dynamically Typed Language
- It's mandatory to declare a type for all variables
