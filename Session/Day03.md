# Methods

- main is a special method which becomes the entry point for the application. The signature for main method should be as follows

```java
public static void main(Strings[] args){

}
```

- Project Day3 will include most examples and notes for today

# Examples

- Reading input
- If
- Switch
- Methods
- for
- do..while
- while
- labels

# Array

- collection of data of same data types
- concept of index, store data on index
- access values using index
- define size beforehand

## definitions

```java
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
int[] arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
int[] arr1 = new int[5];
int[] arr2 = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; // this doesn't really provide us with any benefit if used on Corretto 11
```
