# Oracle Database

- It is the most widely used database
- 97% of Fortune top 100 uses oracle database
- It is a rare view to see an Oracle Database Crash

Oracle database products offer customers cost-optimized, high-performance and high availabiltiy versions of Oracle Database, the world's leading converged, multi-model database management system, as well as in-memory, NoSQL and MySQL databases.

- Oracle Database is the most expensive database(I think)

# Data

- for reference
- to provide better services to customers

# Database

- Organized Collection of data/information
- Easily accessible
- The purpose of a database is to collect, store, and retrieve related information for use by database applications.

# Database Management Systems

# Installing Oracle Database

## Warnings

- There is no uninstaller
- Installation Process has lots of complex options
- Passwords for user accounts. Write them down somewhere.
- Deinstalling it doesn't even remove registry keys and services
- The zip file you download is not actually a setup. 
- Most of oracle's applications are present inside the extracted directory
- If you want to rename the folder, do it before the setup.
- Not easy to refactor

- The setup folder and the path to the setup folder must not contain any space in between
